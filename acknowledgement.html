<p>I personally appreciate these people from these last 19 years.
<br>I never met my grandparents and reptilian ancestors, but I wouldn't be here if it weren't for them, so they're a given.
<br>My papa, mother, and biobro (my family) are extremely important. Not so much my siblings-in-law, nieces, and nephews.
<br><em>Criteria: had more than one conversation, changed my life, something along those lines</em>

<small><br>I won't let you die twice while I'm still alive, but when I do die, let's have that tea party.
"Life is boring if you do not have strong determination and put forth your best efforts in order to unlock your potential.
Who you are is more than just a name. Who you are is a vivid, comprehensive story full of remarkable, unique details authored exclusively by you and still in the process of being written. You determine its contents, not anybody else."</small>
<li>Julia
<small><br>Thank goat that you're the first person to have confessed love to me.</small>
<li>Justin
<small><br>Oi mate.</small>
<li>Kayla
<li>Major (R) Foss
<small><br>Thank you for giving me my first real leadership opportunity.</small>
<li>Mr. Phiasivongsa
<small><br>My favorite academic subject, it turns out, is history.
  "Sometimes it is the people who no one imagines anything of who do the things that no one can imagine."</small>
<li>Mr. Lara
<small><br>I didn't make it to a prestigious university like M.I.T.</small>
<li>Ms. Levi
<small><br>Still my favourite teacher.</small>
<li>Ms. Pages
<small><br>I'm going to illegally add a letter -s to the end of your name.</small>
<li>Mr. Munn
<small><br>I'll come back for some more of those free pencils someday.</small>
<li>Nicholas
<small><br>Childhood friend who I didn't talk to for a decade while we were pretty much always next to each other.</small>
<li>penguins
<li>Thien
<small><br>The first-ever champion of the best friends competition, and reigning childhood best friend champion.</small>
<li>Missus Whose Name I Never Asked for
<small><br>It's the first time my heart raced prettier-pitter-patter. I then wore sunglasses in the dark and wept all the way home.</small>
