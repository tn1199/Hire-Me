<p>I personally appreciate these people from these last 20 years.
<br>I never met my grandparents and reptilian ancestors, but I wouldn't be here if it weren't for them, so they're a given.
<br>My papa, mother, and biobro (my family) are extremely important. Not so much my siblings-in-law, nieces, and nephews.
<br><em>Criteria: had more than one conversation, changed my life, something along those lines</em>
<br><em>I won't dox and give personal info, like real name/address/number.</em>

<li>Pharaoh
<small><br>I won't let you die twice while I'm still alive, but when I do die, let's have that tea party.
"Life is boring if you do not have strong determination and put forth your best efforts in order to unlock your potential.
Who you are is more than just a name. Who you are is a vivid, comprehensive story full of remarkable, unique details authored exclusively by you and still in the process of being written. You determine its contents, not anybody else."</small>
