<h1><font color="white">Welcome to my first website! <em>*flashes smile*</em></font></h1>
<p>I presume that you're checking out the applicant for KFC named "Tony Nguyen." He's a really, really, really, really smart, hard-working gentleman.
   I think he should be hired <em><strong><u>immediately!!</em></strong></u> Call now for a free quote!!!!</p>
<p>Originally, I was going to run around to every hiring location and pass out—pass out my link to several potential employers.
<br>However, I've run out of patience and would like a job now, very specifically from KFC, after examining the doors of its branch at 4545 El Cajon Blvd and texting "KFCJOBS" to 97211.
<br>It's close to my residence, I don't have money or experience, and I'm quite exhausted from having 1 or 2 meals a day for the last 6 months.<br>
