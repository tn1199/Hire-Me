<h2><font color="green">Personal Statement</font color></h2>
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I am a male human being and would prefer to remain that way.
I am poor and would not like to remain that way.
I lack knowledge and would like to fill in the gaps, but the more I close, the more gaps I notice; some gaps exponentially expand.
I would like to be at the forefront of something and develop something that impacts thousands of lives in good ways.
There are always evil ways to things.
A more modern example is the Internet that makes this website possible and also brings devastation to elections.
Tim Berners-Lee wants to fix it.
I do not want to imagine deinternetization.
I would not be able to access my friends and play Fortnite.
Therefore, I have an announcement to make: stop bullying.
Spread some more love.
Something less modern is the atomic bomb.
Denuclearization has made much progress.
Tools are only as good as their users.
I would be uncomfortable with a much simpler life since I know of the complexities of society and choose not to entirely ignore them.
I cannot work on all of them, of course.
There is only so much that a single person can do, which, by the way, is a lot, depending on resources and connections. See Bill Gates?
</p>
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I am quite fortunate to be in America.
Had I been born in a different country, I am fairly certain that I would be living in worse conditions.
Enough about alternate worldlines though.
I am concerned about issues that are not "my own."
It is more like "our" problems and "we" face them together.
We do have personal conflicts and differences, which we either have to resolve or set aside to work together on bigger things.
Even if I do nothing, I am confident and optimistic that others will do something.
I refuse to do nothing, so I will join efforts to combat what diminishes the quality of life and collective learning.
I would like to see the day that humanity knows all there is to the universe.
I do not think that having nine lives like a cat would give my consciousness the time to be aware of that day.
We are becoming faster and better and artificial intellectuals will support us.
I am unsure about the aspect of free will.
There are so many barriers and restrictions raised, most which are necessary in that any argument against them would never win the majority's favor unless everyone's been brainwashed, to give us freedoms.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I do not see the point of violence, but when violence is pointed in your direction, you cannot help but do something to react or respond to it, else something is damaged, lost, or beyond recovery.
I did not really make any personal statements, except at the beginning.
I wish people could think for themselves and get together and we could all have fun and dance, but there will always be an enemy from inside or outside.
I suppose that's the spice of life.
